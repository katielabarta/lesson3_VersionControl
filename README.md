## Project Description:
In this assignment I learned what a version control system is and why git is a good one to work with. I learned basic commands in git and how to set up the repository and how to link it all to cloud9.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version control is something that tracks and saves changes to files so that you are able to go back and use them as neccesary.
2. Git is a Distributed Version Control System that thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots filesystem.
3. Git is different than other version control systems because when you create a clone you aren't just getting a working copy, but a full copy of all data that the server has.
