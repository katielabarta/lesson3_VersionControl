            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is something that tracks and saves changes to files so that you are able to go back and use them as neccesary. This is extremely useful, because it allows the user to bring a file, or even an entire project, back to how it was, see how a project has developed over time, identify problems by comparing changes, and easily recover files that would otherwise seem lost. There are several different types of version control systems, including Local Version Control Systems, Centralized Version Control Systems, and, like the one we will look at today, Distributed Version Control Systems (Git, for example).</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a Distributed Version Control System that thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots filesystem. Each time a project is saved using Git, the program stores a snapshot of all of your files at that moment, and stores them for later reference. An interesting aspect of Git is that you have the entire history of your project stored in your local disk, so you can easily work on it at almost any time. Git is also able to prevent file corruption or lost files because all information is check-summed, which creates integrity. </p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">You start by importing a project into git. To do this, you put "$ cd /Users/user/your_repository" into your terminal and add the command "git init". You now have a subdirectory called ".git", but these files arent actually tracked yet. To start tracking them, you use the "git add" command and what you want to add, as well as "git commit".

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">It is possible to create a clone of an existing repository. Git is different than other version control systems because when you create a clone you aren't just getting a working copy, but a full copy of all data that the server has.</p>

            <p class="lead">The "git status" command tracks and displays the status of your files. You can use the "git add" command to track new files while "git commit" is used to record changes to your repository. To view the files you have edited but not staged, used the "git diff" command. "git mv" is a more complex command that is used to move files.</p>
